# [Architecture](README.md)

## Software Architectural Patterns and development approaches

Architecture is a structure, a way to distribute your application components in various groups. There is not a single way to organize your projects because it could depend on several aspects like project state, team size, time constraints, etc

An architectural pattern is a general, reusable resolution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context.
Pattern is an implementation that solves a particular problem. A principle is an abstraction, a guide to design.

There is no single way to structure a project, and each architecture has its own characteristics. 
Even though you do not define an architecture, following the next principles will lead you to maintain a well-organized code.
