## Code Review Developer Guide

When reviewing PHP code, a PHP developer should check for various aspects to ensure that the code is well-structured, efficient, secure, and adheres to best practices. Here's an instruction checklist for a PHP developer during a code review.

## Principles

- **Self-Review**: Check your code yourself before review.
- **Coding Standards**: Follow Coding Standards and Best Practices to save reviewer time.
- **Feedback as Recommendations**: Feedback should be presented as recommendations, not commands to implement.
- **Improve Code**: The goal is to make the code better, not to find someone to blame.
- **Collective Responsibility**: All developers participate in the review. This increases the level of involvement in the project.
- **Mandatory Reviews**: Code reviews are carried out for each team member without exception.

## Beginning

1. **Understand the Task**: Understand what needs to be done in the task being reviewed.
2. **Branch Check**: Switch to the branch in which the development was carried out.

## Code Structure and Style

- **Code Consistency**: Ensure that the code adheres to the organization's coding standards and style guide.
- **Naming Conventions**: Check that variables, functions, and classes have meaningful and consistent names.
- **Code Indentation**: Verify that the code is correctly indented and formatted for readability.
- **Use of Comments**: Ensure that the code is adequately documented with clear comments for complex logic or non-obvious decisions.
- **Remove Unused Code**: Ensure that the code does not have unused code or unnecessary comments.

## Functionality and Logic

- **Functionality**: Verify that the code implements the required functionality correctly and efficiently.
- **Edge Cases**: Check for handling of edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional scenarios.
- **Code Duplication**: Identify and eliminate duplicated code. Encourage code reusability.
- **Complexity**: Can the code be made simpler?

## Security

- **Input Validation**: Ensure that user inputs are properly validated and sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Check that access controls are correctly implemented to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Secure File Handling**: Verify that file handling operations are secure to prevent file inclusion vulnerabilities.

## Performance and Efficiency

- **Database Queries**: Check the efficiency of database queries and recommend optimizations where necessary.
- **Resource Usage**: Verify that the code does not consume excessive server resources or memory.
- **Caching**: Recommend the use of caching mechanisms for performance improvement when applicable.

## Error Handling

- **Exception Handling**: Check that exceptions are handled gracefully and that error messages do not reveal sensitive information.
- **Logging**: Ensure that relevant information is logged for troubleshooting and debugging.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Verify that the code has appropriate unit tests for the added/modified functionality.
- **Test Coverage**: Check that the unit tests provide good coverage for the code.
- **Postman**: Execute all Postman collection tests and add/modify existing tests.

## Documentation

- **Inline Comments**: Ensure the code is documented with inline comments for clarity.
- **Function/Method Descriptions**: Check that functions and methods are documented with clear descriptions.
- **API Documentation**: Ensure that APIs and public interfaces are well-documented for other developers.

## Version Control (Team Lead)

- **Commits and Messages**: Verify that commits are clear and concise, with meaningful commit messages.
- **Branching Strategy**: Check that the code follows the organization's branching strategy.

## Integration and Deployment (Team Lead)

- **Integration**: Verify that the code integrates seamlessly with other components and services (only if it is high-quality and clean code).
- **Deployment Process**: Check that the code is ready for deployment and follows the deployment process.
